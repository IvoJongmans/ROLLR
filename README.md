# ROLLR
Web application for our rental [scooter project](http://escooter.herokuapp.com/login)

This application is designed [mobile-first](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48712793/66643359-caf8fc80-ec1e-11e9-8642-8d2bcc157de6.jpeg)

We've used the [Stripe Test API](https://stripe.com/docs/development) to implement test payments with creditcards and Ideal transactions.

For user registration and verification we've used an SMS-service called [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com/)
